5.The height of a certain flagpole is 33 feet. Grease is applied to the pole. A monkey attempts to climb the pole. It climbs 5 feet every second but slips down 4 ft in the next second. When will the monkey reach the top of the flagpole?

a)60
b)30
c)57
d)20

ans ==> c) 57 seconds

Since monkey climbs 5 feet in 1st second and slips 4 feet in the next thus the monkey gains 1 ft. net in every two seconds.
However, when it has reached 28ft, in the next jump (5ft upwards) it will reach the top.
It will take 28*2 = 56 seconds to reach 28ft & then 1 sec to reach the top.
Hence, 57 seconds is the correct answer.

7. In a shop, there are 4 dolls of different heights P,Q,R and S. S is neither as tall as P nor as short as R. Q is shorter than S but taller than R. If Kittu wants to purchase the tallest doll, which one should she purchase?
a)  Only P
b)  Only S
c)  Either P or S
d)  Either Q or S

ans == > a

S is not as tall as P, means S is shorter than P, So S<P.
S is not as short as R, S is taller than R, So S>R.
Q is shorter than S but taller than R. So we get, R<Q<S. So P is tallest from the above conditions. Hence answer is (a) option.


8.In how many ways can the members be arranged around a circle so that there is exactly one female between the two sisters present in a group of 20  members?
a) 17!
b) 18!
C) 18!*2
D) 20!

ANS ==> 18!*2
18 members can be arranged around a circle in 17! ways. There are exactly 18 places where the two sisters can be arranged. The sisters can be arranged in 2! ways. 
Therefore, the total number of ways 17! * 2! * 18 = 2 * 18!

        1. Ade is richer than Bola, but shorter than Rafiat.
        2. Bola is richer than Emeka but taller than Rafiat.
        3.Ope is poorer than Peter and taller than Ade.
        4. Peter is poorer as well as shorter than Emeka.
        5. Emeka is poorer as well as shorter than Ade.
        6. Rafiat is richer than Ade and taller than Ope
        
        Who is the richest person out of the given 6 persons?
A) Rafiat
B) Peter
C) Ope
D) Ade

ans ==> A) Rafiat.

Ranking of two attributes is given below is descending order:
1. (Richest to Poorest) Rafiat- Ade- Bola- Emeka- Peter- Ope
2. (Height) Bola- Rafiat- Ope- Ade- Emeka- Peter
Clearly, R is the richest.

11)The sum of the incomes of Ade and Bola is more than that of Charles and Dare together. The sum of the Incomes of Ade and Bola is the same as that of Bola and Date taken together. Moreover, Ade earns half as much as the sum of the incomes of Bola and Dare?
Whose income is the highest?
A)Ade
B) Bola
C) Charles
D) Dare

ans ==>B

Lets take Ade, Bola, Charles and Dare to be A, B, C and D respectively.
We have  (A+B) > (C+D)    (1)
               (A+C) = (B+D)    (2)
               A = 1/2 (B+D)     (3)
Putting the value of A in (2) statement we get A=C
Since (A+B) > (C+D) and A = C so B > D
Thus from (3) we get B > A ans so B > C. Thus clearly B has the highest income.
